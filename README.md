# Bunnii ASCII Video Player

This project is a lightweight HTML player for ASCII animations. It renders text-based frames at a configurable frame rate and supports loading custom frame files.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the playback controls to play, pause, or step through the default animation.
3. Adjust the **Speed** slider to change the frame rate (2â€“20 frames per second).
4. Load your own animation by selecting a text file where frames are separated with a line containing three hyphens (`---`).

A sample animation file is included as `sample-frames.txt`.
